> Available ranks are S (top 1%), A+ (12.5%), A (25%), A- (37.5%), B+ (50%), B (62.5%), B- (75%), C+ (87.5%) and C (everyone). This ranking scheme is based on the [Japanese academic grading](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_Japan) system. The global percentile is calculated as a weighted sum of percentiles for each statistic (number of commits, pull requests, reviews, issues, stars and followers), based on the cumulative distribution function of the [exponential](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/exponential_distribution) and the [log-normal](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution) distributions. The implementation can be investigated at [src/calculateRank.js](./src/calculateRank.js). The circle around the rank shows 100 minus the global percentile.
